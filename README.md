This is a simple Java application (in progress) that does some analysis of MTGO including:
1) Card Drawing probabilities
2) MTGO Event Calculators
3) Draft Analyzer

Feel free to point out any issues or make a contribution yourself! 
I don't plan on profiting off of this software, I just want to make an application that's useful to people.
